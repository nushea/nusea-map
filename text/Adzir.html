			<h3> Adzir </h3>
			<p> The land of the desert empire, spurred from the Dzir river, it is the biggest non-HaRe entity on the continent and is the biggest trading partner with mainland HaSi. </p>
			<br>
			<p> HaAdzir believe in a dualistic religion where Mother God and Father God rule the world and are in constant battle with the Mother Are and Father Are that are the anti-gods and are trying to corrupt the world. Although as an act of kindness towards their partners, the ReHa (the HaRe religion) is allowed, and praying to any Go'a is permitted, you would be advised not to burn any incense in the name of the lost soul of Suffering since in their culture Suffering is known to be a part of the spirit of Love </p>
