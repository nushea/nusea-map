			<h3> HaSi </h3>
			<p> If you want to marvel at the advancements of our world you need to visit Hasi, the land of good, where the cultural mix presents a variety of options, but dont be mistaken, Hasi is still Ha land, so you will be welcomed as a Ga believer, and through thanks to the people of other beliefs you will be able to take comfort in RiMa like nowhere else </p>
