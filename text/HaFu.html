			<p> Hafu represents a miriad of individual places, adventuring through it is bound to bring a new perspective in life, one of understanding why Ga is the religion it is, despite the fact that most places are old order you would be hard pressed to find more religious variety elsewhere, with multiple sea gods you are always under the protection of good spirits no matter where you decide to venture</p>
