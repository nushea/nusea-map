			<h3> Urda </h3>
			<p> A old ex-colony of the Uradt, the land captures a world nowhere else seen, where you can experience the cultural actions of a world an ocean away, where you can see the beauty of the copper of their lands and then drink from the beer of their farms. This land represents the only stable way to trade with the outside old world, as it is the closest land barring the islands to the Kestun continent</p>
